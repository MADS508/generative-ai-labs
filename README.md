# Important! :warning::warning::warning:
‚ùó When asked to login to a Canvas account, you will need to create a new account. This is the AWS Canvas account, and will not be the same as your USD Canvas account.

- In AWS Learner Labs once you reach $100 all of your code will be automatically destroyed. In addition, AWS Learner Labs has occasional issues where your environment is not accessible.
- **Be sure that you are ALWAYS storing your code in GitHub. You will not be given extra time to complete an assignment due to your Learner Lab deleting your code.**
- In order to make it easy to complete labs and work on your project, it is highly reccomended that you follow the below process twice, once for a `lab` user and once for a `project` user (be sure you are saving your work from the `project` user in your own GitHub repository.
